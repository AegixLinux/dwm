By Ultra, I mean the key usually known as the Windows Key. Sometimes it's known as the Super key or the Mod key.
.HEADING 1 "Welcome! Yokoso! Bienvenidos! Willkommen!"
.HEADING 2 "Principles of the system"
.LI
.ITEM
\fBDrive-ability\fP \(en
Learning to drive this system like a car, \f[BI]or a tank\fP, is easy and fun
.ITEM

Capslock is remapped to Escape for convenient vim use.
If you hold it down and it can act as another \fBUltra\fP key.
.ITEM
The menu button, sometimes located between right Alt and right Ctrl, is another alternative \fBUltra\fP key.
.LIST OFF
.PP
These customizations can be found in the \f(CWremaps\fP script along with other custom scripts located in \f(CW~/.local/bin/\fP.
.HEADING 2 "The suckless top bar"
.PP
In the top left of your screen, you'll see at least one number corresponding to what dwm calls a "tag" also sometimes referred to as a "workspace".
On the right, you'll see various system status notifiers, displaying information about things like the time, date, battery status, volume, etc.
Each module on the right of the statusbar is controlled by a script located in \f(CW~/.local/bin/statusbar/\fP.
You can interact with some modules with your mouse. 
Hover your cursor over the battery section and scroll up or down to change the brightness. The source code and configuration for the top bar is located here: \f(CW~/.local/src/dwmblocks/\fP. Feel free to tinker with it.
.HEADING 3 "High-def displays"
.PP
If your top bar text is too small for your liking, you can edit \f(CW~/.config/x11/xprofile\fP, change the \f(CWxrandr --dpi\fP value and reboot.
In order to test what value might work for you, run \f(CWxrandr --dpi 96\fP, in a terminal, replacing 96 with a higher value. After that, "renew dwm," using the the menu at \f(CWUltra+backspace\fP to see the ephemeral change without rebooting. 
.\".HEADING 2 "Deeper tutorials"

.\"Press \f(CWmod+F2\fP at any time to get a menu of programs to watch videos about streaming directly from YouTube.
.\"You can also check the config files for programs which detail a lot of the specific bindings.
.HEADING 1 "The suckless window manager's key bindings"
.PP
TANKLINUX uses dwm, a window manager from suckless that is controlled entirely by the keyboard.
It abstractly orders all of your windows into a stack from most important to least based on your interactions.
If you're unfamiliar, it will be fun to wrap your head around how this stack layout works. Play with the default key bindings. Imagine you're learning a new instrument.

Extra buttons mapped to do things you'd expect, like play, pause, screen brightness, email, web, etc.
.HEADING 1 "Configuration"
.PP
Configuration files commonly known as dotfiles are located in \f(CW~/.config/\fP.
.PP
The suckless programs however, are located in \f(CW~/.local/src/\fP (press \f(CWrr\fP to jump to that directory).
These use \f(CWconfig.h\fP files for configuration. 
After making edits there, you may simply run \f(CWsudo make install\fP for your changes to take effect. In the case of dwm, you can "renew dwm" from the menu accessible via \f(CWUltra+backspace\fP. To see recompiled st changes to st, you may simply spawn a new terminal.
.\".PP
.\"v\"im is set to automatically recompile and install these programs whenever you save changes to any \f(CWconfig.h\fP file
.\"(compilation will be nearly instantaneous).
.\"You'll have to restart the program to see its effects obviously.
.HEADING 1 "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"
.HEADING 2 "My keyboard isn't working as expected!"
.PP
Check the \f(CWremaps\fP script as mentioned above.
.HEADING 2 "My audio isn't working!"
.PP
Check \f(CWpulsemixer\fP (\f(CWMod+F4\fP).
.HEADING 2 "How do I copy and paste?"
.PP
In most graphical programs, copy and paste will be the same as they are on other systems: \f(CWctrl-c\fP and \f(CWctrl-v\fP.
In the terminal, those key bindings do other things. Instead, use \f(CWAlt-c\fP and \f(CWAlt-v\fP.
.PP
Additionally, vim is set to use the clipboard as the default buffer, which means when you yank or delete something in vim, it will be in your system clipboard as well, so you can \f(CWctrl-v\fP it into your browser, for instance. You can also paste material copied from other programs into vim with the typical vim bindings.
.HEADING 2 "How do I change the opacity of the terminal on the fly?"
.PP
You can change the opacity of the terminal, on the fly, by holding \f(CWAlt\fP and tapping \f(CWs/a\fP.
You can change it permanently by editing \f(CWst/config.h\fP and recompiling st.
.HEADING 2 "How do I change the background/wallpaper?"
.PP
The system will always read the file \f(CW~/.local/share/bg\fP as the wallpaper.
The script \f(CWsetbg\fP, if run on an image will set it as the persistent background.
When using the file manager, you can simply hover over an image name and type \f(CWb\fP and this will run \f(CWsetbg\fP.
.HEADING 2 "How I change the colorscheme?"
.PP
Check \f(CW~/.config/x11/xresources\fP for a list of color schemes you can activate or add your own. When you save the file, vim will automatically update the colorscheme. If you'd like these colors activated by default on login, there is a line in \f(CW~/.config/x11/xprofile\fP you can uncomment to allow that.
.PP
Or, if you want to use \f(CWwal\fP to automatically generate colorschemes from your wallpapers, just install it and \f(CWsetbg\fP will automatically detect and run it on startup and wallpaper change.
.HEADING 2 "How do I update BARBS or TANKLINUX?"
.PP
To update your TANKLINUX, there is an alias \f(CWupdate\fP you can run from the terminal. 
Type: \f(CW alias update\fP to see the command it will run.
.PP
I don't recommend updating BARBS specifically after it is installed as part of TANKLINUX. 
BARBS is deployed as a git repository in your home directory, and as such you can git pull changes to it if you wish.
If you prefer a more brute force approach that will overwrite all your user config files and install any new dependencies, you may just rerun the barbs.sh script, as root, entering the same username, but this is not always guaranteed to go smoothly.
.HEADING 1 "Some neat links"
.PP
You can follow links via the keyboard in this pdf reader by pressing \f(CWf\fP followed by the number that appears on the desired link.
